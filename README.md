# Predicting-Melting-of-Sea-Ice by Sondre Wik 5870437

I
This project aims to predict Arctic sea ice melting using historical data and machine learning. The focus will be on building a model to forecast future ice loss, with an emphasis on good coding practices, documentation, and version control. Model accuracy is less critical than proper implementation.

II
We’ll use time series forecasting methods like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and possibly LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks if needed. Key libraries include:
pandas and numpy for data prep
scikit-learn for evaluating the model
statsmodels for ARIMA

III
We’ll use sea ice extent data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) or similar sources. This includes monthly measurements of Arctic sea ice over recent decades. Data cleaning will address gaps, outliers, and missing values.

IV
The project will deliver a model to predict future sea ice extent based on past data. We’ll use metrics like RMSE and MAE to evaluate the model. The final product will be a well-documented, modular codebase with clear instructions and tests for ease of use and maintenance.
